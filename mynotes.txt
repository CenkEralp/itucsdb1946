{{ }}

For this purpose, we’re going to use Jinja, 
which is the default template system used by Flask.

In Jinja templates, the parts marked with {{ and }} will be replaced 
by the value of the expression they contain. 
The parameters in the expression
have to be supplied by the view function that renders this template. 
------------------------
The {% block ... %} and {% endblock %}

url_for

which lets us look up the URL of a page in the application. Routing rules consist of
three components:

The route in the application, e.g. /movies.
The view function that will handle the requests to this route, e.g. movies_page.
The name of the endpoint, which is an identifier for the route. 
If not given, this will be the 
same as the name of the view function, e.g. movies_page. [1]

url_for('static', filename='mymovies.css') }
